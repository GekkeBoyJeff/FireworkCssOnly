## Week 1 planning
- [x] uittekenen hoe ik het ontwerp wil maken
- [x] Een uitschuifbaar menu maken
- [ ] Een werkende vuurpijl maken

This week it was my intention to make a basis for the assignment. Unfortunately, not everything worked out.

### Sketches:
I started drawing out my menu which came out like this

I moestly designed the UI with this sketch. It occurred to me that I should have a form with a number of fieldsets. As indicated above, the foldable menus are the field sets.

The basic HTML I was able to get out from my sketch for this week is as follows
![](./assets/HtmlW1.png)The input fields in the middle (of the image above) are for sliding the field sets in and out.

### Css
For the base I have not yet taken into account the final styling because I still want to determine that.

As shown above, you can press both labels to slide out the menus. The "buttons" in the menu on the left have not been further developed yet.

### Feedback week 1
During the feedback conversation it came up that I used the has selector perfectly to make this. Below you see an image of the css selector in which I place the menu at the location on the left.

#### Takeaways
- Continue with your assignment. Speed it up a bit because you don't have flares and explosions yet. 
- I can eventually make something of a gallery of different firecrackers that become visible when I press another button. This can also be my process book at the same time.


## Start week 2
This week I'll continue with my takeaways from last week, the plan is to add the firecracker animation and add the explosion in multiple ways. I also have to add the textboxes on the bottom as shown in the layout sketch in week 1.

- [ ] Add a firecracker
- [ ] Add the animation to make it fly upwards
- [ ] Add the explosion
- [ ] Make the layout prettier
- [ ] Add a background
- [ ] Add layered backgrounds
